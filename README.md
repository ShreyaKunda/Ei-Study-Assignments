## Assignment 2: Rocket Launch Simulator

### Overview
The Rocket Launch Simulator is a terminal-based program designed to simulate the process of launching a rocket and placing a satellite into orbit. The simulator provides real-time updates on the rocket's status during the mission.

### Functional Requirements
1. **Pre-Launch Checks:** 
   - User initiates checks by typing `start_checks`.
   - The system outputs: "All systems are 'Go' for launch."
  
2. **Launch and Stage Updates:** 
   - User starts the launch by typing `launch`.
   - The terminal updates the stage, fuel, altitude, and speed every second.

3. **Fast Forward:** 
   - User can fast-forward the simulation by typing `fast_forward X`, where X is the number of seconds to advance.
   - The program calculates and displays the updated parameters after X seconds.

### Usage
To run the simulator:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
