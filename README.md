## Assignment 1: Design Patterns

This assignment demonstrates the application of various software design patterns through six unique use cases.

### Behavioral Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1:** [Brief description of your first behavioral design pattern use case]
2. **Use Case 2:** [Brief description of your second behavioral design pattern use case]

### Creational Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1:** [Brief description of your first creational design pattern use case]
2. **Use Case 2:** [Brief description of your second creational design pattern use case]

### Structural Design Patterns
1. **Use Case 1:** [Brief description of your first structural design pattern use case]
2. **Use Case 2:** [Brief description of your second structural design pattern use case]

## Assignment 2: Rocket Launch Simulator

### Overview
The Rocket Launch Simulator is a terminal-based application that simulates the launch of a rocket and the subsequent placement of a satellite into orbit. The program provides real-time updates on the rocket's status throughout the mission.

### Functional Requirements
1. **Pre-Launch Checks:** 
   - Users initiate the pre-launch checks by typing `start_checks`.
   - The system confirms: "All systems are 'Go' for launch."
  
2. **Launch and Stage Updates:** 
   - Users start the launch sequence by typing `launch`.
   - The program updates the rocket's stage, fuel level, altitude, and speed every second.

3. **Fast Forward:** 
   - Users can advance the simulation by typing `fast_forward X`, where X is the number of seconds to skip.
   - The simulator calculates and displays updated parameters after X seconds.

### Usage
To run the simulator, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
